# Process Historical Local Election Data for Nepal 

Data: Nepalese local elections in the pre-democratic period (1980s) and post (1990s). Raw data is split across spreadsheets corresponding to each village in 75 districts with varying numbers of villages (total of $\approx$ 3500 villages).

Code walks through these folders, normalises their output, stacks, and cleans it to produce a single big CSV for each election.
